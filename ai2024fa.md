## Overview  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about designing algorithms that enable machines to either behave like humans or assist humans in solving complex problems. In this course, we will explore several fundamental tools that help achieve these goals, including **search**, **logical reasoning**, **statistical learning**, and **reinforcement learning**. Additionally, we will discuss recent advance in generative AI, along with the associated safety and ethical issues.  

## Prerequisites  
- Data Structures and Algorithms 2 (CS 3100)  
- Probability (APMA 3100)  
- Calculus (APMA 1110 and 2120)

## Grading
- (40%) **Assignments**: 6 problem sets, each consisting of programming tasks and multiple choice questions.     
- (25%) **Midterm Exam**  
- (35%) **Final Exam**  

**Late policy for assignments**: Five late days can be used for free. Each additional late day will result in a 10% reduction in the semester's assignment grade.
