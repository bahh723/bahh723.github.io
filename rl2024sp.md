## Course Information  
- **Instructor**: [Chen-Yu Wei](https://bahh723.github.io/)  
- **TA**: Haolin Liu  
- **Time**: MW 9:30-10:45  
- **Location**: Rice Hall 340  

## Overview  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful learning paradigm through which machines learn to make (sequential) decisions. It has been playing a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence, with notable successes such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961" target="_blank">mastering the game of Go</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences" target="_blank">enhancing large language models</a>.  

This course focuses on the design principles of RL algorithms. Similar to statistical learning, a central challenge in RL is to **generalize** learned capabilities to unseen environments.  However, RL also faces additional challenges such as **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**, **temporal credit assignment**, and **distribution mismatch** between data and target policies. Throughout the course, we will delve into various approaches to these challenges, and provide theoretical justifications.  

## Prerequisites  
This course is mathematically demanding. Students are expected to have strong foundations in **probability**, **linear algebra**, **calculus**, and **convex analysis**. A basic understanding of machine learning and convex optimization will be beneficial. Proficiency in **python** programming is also required. 

## Grading
- (60%) **Assignments**: 4 problem sets, each consisting of theoretical questions and programming tasks.   
- (40%) **Final project**: May be a hands-on implementation addressing practical problems, or an investigation of relevant theoretical questions.

## Topics
- Exploration in bandit problems  
- Fundamentals of Markov decision processes (MDPs)  
- Policy evaluation methods  
- Policy learning methods  
- Exploration in MDPs  
- Offline reinforcement learning
