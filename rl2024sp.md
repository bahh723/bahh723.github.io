## Overview  
Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool that enables machines to learn how to act and has been pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence. Its notable successes include mastering the game of Go and enhancing large language models.   

This course dives into the design principles behind reinforcement learning algorithms. Beyond **generalization** to unseen environments, reinforcement learning faces additional challenges such as the **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**, **temporal credit assignment** issues, and **distribution shifts** between data and target policies. Throughout the course, we will examine these challenges and provide theoretical insights.
