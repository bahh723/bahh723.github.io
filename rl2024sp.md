## Overview  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool that enables machines to learn how to act. It has been playing a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence, with notable successes including mastering the game of Go and enhancing large language models.   

This course dives into the design principles of RL algorithms. Besides **generalization** to unseen environments, RL faces additional challenges arising from **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**, **temporal credit assignment**, and **distribution mismatch** between data and target policies. Throughout the course, we will examine these challenges and provide theoretical insights into their solutions.  

## Prerequisite  
This course is mathematically demanding. Students are expected to have a strong foundation in **probability**, **linear algebra**, **calculus**, and **convex analysis**. A basic understanding of machine learning and convex optimization will be beneficial. Proficiency in **python** programming is also required.
