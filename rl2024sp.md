## Overview  
Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool that enables machines to learn how to act has been pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence. Its notable successes include mastering the game of Go and enhancing large language models. This course aims to offer an in-depth discussion on the design principles of reinforcement learning algorithms. Beyond the challenge of **generalization** to unseen environments, reinforcement learning faces additional complex challenges: the **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**, **temporal credit assignment** issues, and **distribution shifts** between behavior policies and target policies. To address them, we will examine the following questions: How should the learner interact with the environment to acquire valuable data? Which objective is the right one to optimize? And how can the objective be optimized efficiently? Throughout the course, we will delve into these questions and provide theoretical insights.
