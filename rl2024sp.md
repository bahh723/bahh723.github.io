## Overview  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful learning paradigm through which machines learn to make (sequential) decisions. It has been playing a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence, with notable successes including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961" target="_blank">mastering the game of Go</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences" target="_blank">enhancing large language models</a>.  

This course focuses on the design principles of RL algorithms. Similar to statistical learning, a central challenge in RL is to **generalize** learned capabilities to unseen environments.  However, RL also faces additional challenges such as **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**, **credit assignment**, and **distribution mismatch** between behavior and target policies. Throughout the course, we will delve into various solutions to these challenges and provide theoretical justifications.  

## Prerequisites  
This course is mathematically demanding. Students are expected to have strong foundations in **probability**, **linear algebra**, and **calculus**. A basic understanding of machine learning and convex optimization will be beneficial. Proficiency in **python** programming is required. 

## Grading
- (60%) **Assignments**: 4 problem sets, each consisting of theoretical questions and programming tasks.   
- (35%) **Final project**: See [here](https://bahh723.github.io/course/final_project.pdf){:target="_blank"} for the specification.  
- (5%) **Class participation**
