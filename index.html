I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at University of Southern California.  I am very fortunate to be advised by Haipeng Luo. I received my M.S. in Communication Engineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University. My research mainly focuses on designing provable algorithms for online decision making, reinforcement learning, and learning in multi-player games.
