I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the **University of Virginia**. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, working with [Prof. Sasha Rakhlin](http://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the **University of Southern California**, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I also had the privilege of working with [Prof. Chi-Jen Lu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/cjlu/){:target="_blank"} at **Academia Sinica**, a collaboration that ignited my current research interest. I hold an M.S. degree in Communication Engineering and a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, both from **National Taiwan University**.   

I am broadly interested in the field of interactive machine learning. My work is centered around the following topics:   
- Robust and adaptive learning algorithms that handle non-stationary or adversarial environments;   
- Sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms that perform strategic exploration over large state spaces;   
- Decentralized multi-agent learning algorithms with efficient communication and coordination.  

I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities, particularly those with a strong potential for practical application.
