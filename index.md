I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the **University of Virginia**. Before, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with [Prof. Alexander (Sasha) Rakhlin](http://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/){:target="_blank"}, and a Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the **University of Southern California**, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/){:target="_blank"}. Please find my CV [here](/document/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Research

I am broadly interested in the field of interactive machine learning. My work is centered around the following topics:   
- Robust and adaptive learning algorithms for non-stationary or adversarial environments;   
- Sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms with strategic exploration;   
- Decentralized multi-agent learning algorithms with efficient communication and coordination.  

I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities, particularly those with a strong potential for practical application.
