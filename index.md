I am a postdoctoral associate at MIT working with [Prof. Sasha Rakhlin](http://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/){:target="_blank"}. I will join the Computer Science department at the **University of Virginia** as an assistant professor from Fall 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the **University of Southern California**, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/){:target="_blank"}. I received my M.S. degree in Communication Engineering and my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering both from **National Taiwan University**.  

My research focuses on fundamental problems in online learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent learning.
