I am a Research Fellow at the **Simons Institute of the Theory of Computing**, under the [Data-Driven Decision Processes](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/datadriven2022) program.  I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the **University of Southern California**, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/){:target="_blank"}. I received my M.S. in Communication Engineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from **National Taiwan University**.  

Currently, I focus on designing provable algorithms for online learning, reinforcement learning, and learning in multi-player games.
