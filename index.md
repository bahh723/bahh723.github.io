I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at **University of Southern California**.  I am very fortunate to be advised by [Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/). I received my M.S. in Communication Engineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from **National Taiwan University**. My research mainly focuses on designing provable algorithms for online decision making, reinforcement learning, and learning in multi-player games.
