I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the **University of Virginia**. Prior to joining UVA, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with [Prof. Sasha Rakhlin](http://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the **University of Southern California**, where I was advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/){:target="_blank"}. 

<!-- My current interest in online learning was ignited during my time at **Academia Sinica**, where I worked with [Prof. Chi-Jen Lu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/cjlu/){:target="_blank"}. I hold a M.S. degree in Communication Engineering and a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, both obtained from **National Taiwan University**.  -->

## Research

I am broadly interested in the field of interactive machine learning. My work is centered around the following topics:   
- Robust and adaptive learning algorithms for non-stationary or adversarial environments;   
- Sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms with strategic exploration;   
- Decentralized multi-agent learning algorithms with efficient communication and coordination.  

I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities, particularly those with a strong potential for practical application.
