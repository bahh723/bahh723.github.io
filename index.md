I am a postdoctoral associate at MIT working with [Prof. Sasha Rakhlin](http://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/){:target="_blank"}, and will be an assistant professor in the Computer Science department at the **University of Virginia** from Fall 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the **University of Southern California**, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to this, I received my M.S. degree in Communication Engineering and my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering both from **National Taiwan University**.  

My research focuses on fundamental problems in interactive decision-making and reinforcement learning. Specifically, I am interested in developing **robust and adaptive algorithms** that interact with the environment without the need for strong assumptions on it. Also, I am interested in understanding the **sample and computational complexity** involved in reinforcement learning problems, and devising efficient algorithms to tackle them.
